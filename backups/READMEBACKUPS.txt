Welcome to the Backups README File!

In this folder, there are backups of the SFC (Simple Fast Computer Code) editor just in case the one being used doesnt work. These are for test purposes.
If you want to use one, drag it out of the backups folder and into the main one. Only then will it work (Otherwise a local asset library it needs (Codemirror) cant be found.).
Have fun!
